# CJ-_Scrap_FALL_INTERN_2022

There are a lot of notes that we put on the scrap file so if you want to know how each part of the code works
just go through and read the comments. 

Here are the steps to run the code:
1. Fill out the username/password/query
2. Press run
3. We did not program the location so make sure you keep an eye out. The location will have to be manually inputed, 
you will only have 20 seconds to input the location and distance from that location.
4. Let the script run

Tips: 
1. Make sure you close the excel sheet before the code is ran.
    a. Error permission denied means that the excel sheet that is being used by the code is still opened.
2. Keep the chrome page in full screen.
3. **Important** If the applicant number is the same, the excel file will be overwritten. The data might be deleted.
4. **Important** The excel file will be saved to the same folder the script is in. So, to clean it up move it to the fill named "excelfiles"
