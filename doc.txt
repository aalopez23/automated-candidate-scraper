Hi, Jonathan- 

Thanks for the heads up.  

I want to be 100% certain of your position before I take this off the table, given this is such an ideal role for growth across such a long-term contract. 

  

And in my experience, employer counter offers are wonderful until they’re not; with the employer is now privy to their employee having interviewed for other jobs, so please confirm with that’s a risk you’re OK taking before I pull this offer, as we’d still love to have you!

Good morning, 

  

CDW has decided that I am too valuable to lose and countered your offer with another position. I truly appreciate the offer and all the work that we went through throughout this process. Unfortunately, I am choosing to stay with CDW and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Thank you for the opportunity, I hope you'll find another candidate very soon. 

  

Very respectfully, 

  

Johnathan Russell
